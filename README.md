# Hybrid Neural Network + SVM Classifier

A hybrid deep learning model that combines Neural Networks (NN), Random Fourier Features (RFF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for robust multi-class classification on high-dimensional datasets. Designed for scenarios where feature extraction with NN improves separability before classification with an SVM.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project aims to:

- Combine **Neural Networks** for non-linear feature extraction
- Use **Random Fourier Features (RFF)** to approximate kernel mappings
- Train a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for the final classification stage
- Handle **imbalanced datasets** using techniques like SMOTE
- Support both binary and multi-class classification using One-vs-Rest

This architecture is particularly useful when raw features are not linearly separable, but transformed features extracted from NN layers provide better class discrimination.
